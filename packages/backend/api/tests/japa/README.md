# Japa tests (placeholder)

This project currently executes deterministic backend tests with `bun:test` due registry/network constraints.

When package installation is available:
1. Install `@japa/runner` and `@japa/assert` in `@backend/api`.
2. Replace this placeholder with real Japa integration suites for:
   - `GET /health`
   - `POST /users/execute`
   - `POST /users/clear`
